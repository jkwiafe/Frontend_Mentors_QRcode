## My process

I divided the various parts of the qrcode into parts and worked with them accordingly

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I have to know how to use divs and sections, and how to style them very well.

### Continued development

I was not able to reduce the space between the text and the picture; I'd have to work on it.

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS in 20 Mins](https://youtu.be/1PnVor36_40?si=PM3sne7wB0GT514j) - This helped me for the CSS part of the code. I really liked this and will use it going forward.
- [The box theory](https://web.dev/learn/css/box-model) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand a little about the elements. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning.
